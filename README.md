# One-Offs

This is a collection of one-off scripts that we have written during the course of our everyday work. These scripts were designed to accomplish some specific task(s), but we are holding onto them in case they are useful elsewhere. In other words, we are hoarders, and this is our junk drawer. We have grouped the scripts by language. You will find a brief description of each script in the README of their respective directory. Naturally, these scripts come with no guarantees. Enjoy!
